# Introduction

Profile

Andrew Boynton here. I am a graduate student at Duke's Fuqua school of business working on my Master of Quantitative Management. I am particularly interested in sports analytics projects, specifically basketball (I played collegiately for Anderson University). I mostly use R, Python, and Tableau for my projects.
